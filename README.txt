Project Explanation in Simple Terms

Project Overview: The goal of this project is to create an “invisible cloak” effect using a webcam and OpenCV, a computer vision library. Specifically, the project is designed to detect and hide a red-colored cloth from the webcam feed, making it appear as though the cloth is invisible.

How It Works:

	1.	Camera Setup: The webcam captures the video feed.
	2.	Background Capture: The program first captures a background image to understand what’s behind the subject (in this case, the red cloth).
	3.	Color Detection: The program detects the red color in the live video feed using color thresholds in the HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) color space.
	4.	Background Subtraction: To improve the effect, background subtraction is used to separate the foreground (the red cloth) from the background.
	5.	Masking: The detected red areas (the cloth) are masked out in the final output, making the red cloth appear invisible.

Result: The final result shows the video feed with the red cloth removed, revealing the background behind it as if the cloth were invisible.
